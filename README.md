# Ecommerce Shopping Cart using React-Redux

## Description: https://bloom-shopping-cart.herokuapp.com/

A single-page ecommerce application built with React-Redux and styled with TailwindCSS.

## Learning Outcomes

This project was created in congruence with React and Redux documentation, tutorials and courses as a means for active learning. It was helpful to work on this project while learning React/Redux concepts to reinforce my knowledge. It was also a challenge for me to practice my UI/UX skills and design a real-world ecommerce website.

## Features
* A real-world ecommerce website with a fully functional shopping cart.
* Filter products by specfic collection
* Clean, minimalist UI design
* Responsive design

## Tools and Technologies
* Javascript
* React.js (react-router)
* Redux.js (react-redux, redux-toolkit)
* Tailwind CSS

## Challenges
* Struggled to implement Redux into the application, used Redux-Toolkit to simplify the process.
* Implementing nested Routes with react-router hooks
* Organizing and structuring a larger project, especially when implementing Redux
* Styling elements for better UX design.
* Issues with deployment through github pages - used Heroku instead

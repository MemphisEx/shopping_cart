# Ecommerce Shopping Cart using React-Redux
## Live Demo: https://bloom-shopping-cart.herokuapp.com/

## Description

A single-page ecommerce application built with React-Redux and styled with TailwindCSS.

## Learning Outcomes

This project was created in congruence with React and Redux tutorials, courses and documentation as a means for active learning. It was helpful to work on this project while learning React/Redux concepts to reinforce my knowledge. It was also a challenge for me to practice my UI/UX skills and design a real-world ecommerce website.

## Features
* A real-world ecommerce website with a fully functional shopping cart.
* Filter products by specfic collection
* Clean, minimalist UI design

## Tools and Technologies
* Javascript
* React.js (react-router)
* Redux.js (react-redux, redux-toolkit)
* Tailwind CSS

## Challenges
* Struggled to implement Redux into the application, used Redux-Toolkit to simplify the process.
* Implementing nested Routes with react-router hooks
* Organizing and structuring a larger project, especially when implementing Redux
* Styling elements for better UX design.
* Issues with deployment through github pages - used Heroku instead

## Immediate Concerns/Updates
* Fix responsive design of site 

## Potential Updates
* Incorporate backend to store products and allow users to checkout (Stripe API)
* Add animations to make page more interactive - loading screen, shopping cart and home page animations

# Ecommerce Shopping Cart using React-Redux
## Live Demo: https://bloom-shopping-cart.herokuapp.com/

## Description

A single-page ecommerce application built with React-Redux and styled with TailwindCSS.

## Learning Outcomes

This project was created alongside React and Redux tutorials, courses and documentation as a means for active learning. 
It was also a test of my CSS skills to see if I could design a real-world ecommerce website.
It was beneficial to create this project while learning React/Redux as it reinforced any gaps in my knowledge. 
As this project was used as a learning experience primarily for React/Redux, images are not properly optimized so web performance may be affected.

## Features
* A real-world ecommerce website with a fully functional shopping cart.
* Filter products by specfic collection
* Clean, minimalist UI design

## Tools and Technologies
* Javascript
* React.js (react-router)
* Redux.js (react-redux, redux-toolkit)
* Tailwind CSS

## Challenges
* Struggled to implement Redux into the application, used Redux-Toolkit to simplify the process.
* Implementing nested Routes with react-router hooks
* Organizing and structuring a larger project, especially with Redux
* Styling elements for better UX design.
* Issues with deployment through github pages - used Heroku instead

## Immediate issues
* Optimize images for quicker loading (properly size images)
* Fix responsive design of site 

## Potential Updates
* Incorporate backend to store products and allow users to checkout (e.g. Stripe API)
* Add animations to make page more interactive - loading screen, shopping cart and home page animations

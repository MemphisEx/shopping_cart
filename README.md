# Ecommerce Shopping Cart using React-Redux

A single-page ecommerce application built with React-Redux. 

## Learning Outcomes

This project was created in congruence with React and Redux documentation, tutorials and courses as a means for active learning. It was helpful to work on this project while learning React/Redux concepts to solidify the knowledge. It was also a challenge for me to practice my UI/UX skills and design a real-world ecommerce website.

# Ecommerce Shopping Cart using React-Redux
## Live Demo: https://bloom-shopping-cart.herokuapp.com/

## Description

A single-page ecommerce application built with React-Redux, styled with TailwindCSS, and deployed with Heroku.

## Learning Outcomes

This project was created alongside React and Redux tutorials, courses and documentation as a means for active learning. 
It was also a test of my CSS skills to see if I could design a real-world ecommerce website.
Developing this project while learning React/Redux was beneficial as it reinforced any gaps in my knowledge.

9/2/21 - Updated to be responsive on mobile devices. Great practice working with different media queries/breakpoints.

## Features
* A real-world eCommerce website with a fully functional shopping cart.

## Tools and Technologies
* Javascript
* React.js (react-router)
* Redux.js (react-redux, redux-toolkit)
* Tailwind CSS
* Hosted on Heroku

## Challenges
* Difficulty making the site responsive on mobile, initial styling was a mess so it took some effort to clean up my mistakes (used a lot of absolute positioning - fixed using flexbox and grid)
* Struggled to implement Redux into the application, used Redux-Toolkit to simplify the process.
* Implementing nested Routes with react-router hooks
* Organizing and structuring a larger project, especially with Redux. 
* Designing the layout of the site

## Immediate issues/Potential Updates
* Fix responsive design of site for mobile (Updated 9/2/21)

* Add animations to make page more interactive - loading screen, scroll and page transition animations.
* Store products in a backend database

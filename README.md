# Ecommerce Shopping Cart using React-Redux
## Live Demo: https://bloom-shopping-cart.herokuapp.com/

## Description

A single-page ecommerce application built with React-Redux and styled with TailwindCSS.

## Learning Outcomes

This project was created alongside React and Redux tutorials, courses and documentation as a means for active learning. 
It was also a test of my CSS skills to see if I could design a real-world ecommerce website.
Developing this project while learning React/Redux was beneficial as it reinforced any gaps in my knowledge.

> Note: As this was a project to primarily learn React and Redux, this site is not optimized for mobile viewing.

## Features
* A real-world eCommerce website with a fully functional shopping cart.
* Filter products by specfic collection
* Clean, minimalist UI design

## Tools and Technologies
* Javascript
* React.js (react-router)
* Redux.js (react-redux, redux-toolkit)
* Tailwind CSS
* Hosted on Heroku

## Challenges
* Difficulty making the site responsive on mobile, should have began with mobile first design before styling for larger screens.
* Struggled to implement Redux into the application, used Redux-Toolkit to simplify the process.
* Implementing nested Routes with react-router hooks
* Organizing and structuring a larger project, especially with Redux
* Non-trivial amount of time figuring out the design and creating it.

## Immediate issues
* Fix responsive design of site for mobile

## Potential Updates
* Add animations to make page more interactive - loading screen, scroll and page transition animations.
* Incorporate backend to store products and allow users to enter checkout screen.
